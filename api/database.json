      "bio": "Bio: My passion for cars (or really anything with a motor) started when I was around 10. I begged my dad to let me start mowing the grass so that I could drive the riding lawn mower. When he finally gave in, we had to wrap iron chains around the seat because I didn't weigh enough and without the chain, the mower's safety sensor would cut the engine off. I finally got behind the wheel of a car when I was 14 and that excitement has never gone away. I have been fortunate to have driven and worked on a lot of different cars, and through that have grown an immense appreciation to the design and engineering put into cars. Cars truly are art, and they invoke many different emotions. The look, the sound, the feeling of smooth, cool, shiny metal and g-forces pushing you back into the seat, the smell of gasoline, exhaust and burnt rubber. Some of the best things in my life have happened in, around or because of cars, and those memories are ones that I will hold on to forever.",

An employee that I was talking to mentioned that they were storing several hypercars for a VIP customer, and then allowed me to go with them to the back and check out the cars. It was an amazing experience, and very special to me as I got to see 3 cars I had never seen before: a Porsche 918 Spyder, a Lamborghini Veneno, and one of my all-time favorites, the Maserati MC12.",

This was special because I came from Knoxville and my dad met me from Nashville, and we made it a guys' trip. We ogled at the cars the night they came in, went and grabbed some food and beer, and then woke up early the next morning to ogle at the cars some more as they headed out.",

The morning we left Houston to head to Galveston, we stopped by Ferrari of Houston because, well, I wanted to check out the Ferraris they had, and I also heard they had a Chiron. Turns out, they did, and it was probably my favorite Chiron spec I could imagine. The gentleman whose desk was right beside the Chiron was incredibly friendly and welcoming, and chatted to us for a while about it while he let us look it over. Another amazing dealership experience and absolutely stunning car, specced in Royal Blue visible carbon, black wheels, and Italian Red interior.",
