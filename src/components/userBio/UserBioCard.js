        <p>Bio: My passion for cars (or really anything with a motor) started when I was around 10. I begged my dad to let me start mowing the grass so that I could drive the riding lawn mower. When he finally gave in, we had to wrap iron chains around the seat because I didn't weight enough and without the chain, the mower's safety sensor would cut the engine off. I finally got behind the wheel of a car when I was 14 and that excitement has never gone away. I have been fortunate to have driven and worked on a lot of different types of cars, and through that have grown an immense appreciation to the design and engineering put into cars. Cars truly are art, and they invoke many different emotions. The look, the sound, the feeling of smooth, cool, shiny metal and g-forces pushing you back into the seat, the smell of gasoline, exhaust and burnt rubber. Some of the best things in my life have happened in, around or because of cars, and those memories are ones that I will hold on to forever. </p>
